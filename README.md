# Customer Support Chatbot

This project is a **Customer Support Chatbot** designed to assist users by responding to predefined intents. Built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **TensorFlow**, this chatbot is capable of recognizing intents and providing appropriate responses. The project is a great starting point for exploring machine learning applications in customer service.

## Features

- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies the user's intent based on input queries.
- **Predefined Dataset**: Utilizes a JSON file to define patterns and responses for various intents.
- **Interactive Chat**: Provides a terminal-based interface for real-time interaction.
- **Customizable Framework**: Easily extendable with new intents, patterns, and responses.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-support-chatbot.git
   cd customer-support-chatbot
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy nltk
   ```

3. Download required NLTK packages:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

## Usage

1. **Train the Chatbot**:
   - Run the `chatbot.py` script to preprocess data, train the model, and save it:
     ```bash
     python chatbot.py
     ```

2. **Interact with the Chatbot**:
   - Once training is complete, the chatbot will start a terminal-based interface.
   - Type your queries, and the chatbot will respond based on the intents defined in `intents.json`.

---

## Example Interaction

```bash
You: Hi
Bot: Hello! How can I assist you?

You: What products do you have?
Bot: We offer a wide range of products including electronics, clothing, and accessories.

You: Thanks!
Bot: You're welcome!
```

## Possible Improvements

1. **Use a More Complex Dataset**:
   - Replace the current intents with a more comprehensive dataset covering diverse customer service scenarios.
   - Include real-world examples and variations in user queries.

2. **Integrate APIs for Dynamic Responses**:
   - Connect the chatbot with APIs (e.g., for product catalogs, order tracking) to provide real-time information.

3. **Implement Transformer-Based Models**:
   - Use advanced models like **BERT** or **GPT** for better contextual understanding and intent recognition.

4. **Deploy on Web or Messaging Platforms**:
   - Deploy the chatbot using **Flask** or **Django**.
   - Integrate it with platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Slack for a wider audience reach.
